32	1000020	Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didnt submit this\n\nIm not sure whether adding a member in IFile just because of that is a good approach. This highlight info bar is only used by the plain text editor and if the user has this option set. This is probably a significant minority (if any) of all IFile instances around a given moment.\n\nI would suggest a more scalable solution in which IFile is able to *identify* the active info bars and in the case of a request for a duplicate bar it could simply ignore it (the API could make that clear).

32	1000020	Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didnt submit this\n\nI would still prefer my previous suggestion... But if you go for this bool member approach Im ok if its added to the PlainTextEditorWidget itself, since its the only editor to which this warning message exists and make sense (and it already has other members related to this like, for example, m_isMissingSyntaxDefinition).
32	1000020	Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved\n\nOk, I would still prefer the previous suggestion... But I think its ok to keep this for now. We should keep it in mind to improve the info bar.
